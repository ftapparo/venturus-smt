# VENTURUS
## Squad Management Tool
 
## Description

This project is part of a technical assessment of my knowledge in the front-end development area requested by the company Venturus.

I made the choice to use the JavaScript React library to build this project [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), however the whole visual implementation I am using only HTML and CSS purely.

When I implement new features to the project, this Readme.md will also be updated, making it easier to understand the use.

Finally, this project has no reason for commercialization or use, only for studies. 


## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
